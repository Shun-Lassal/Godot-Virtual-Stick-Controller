# Godot Virtual Stick Controller

Virtual Stick controller for mobile platforms

Made in Godot 4, works in Godot 3.5

-=-=-=-=--=-=-

In this godot project, you have:

- Game scene (Where the map and the controller are)
- Controller scene (The player controller that has the virtual stick and the camera)

You can change the camera, controls, moving configs of the player in the "Controller" Node
and if you're looking to make small changes about the virtual stick it is in the "Analog" Node

Feel free to use.
